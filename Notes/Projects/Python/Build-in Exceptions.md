# Warnings
The following exceptions are used as warning categories; see the [[warnings - Warning control#Warning Categories|Warning Categories]] documentation for more details
#### *exception* `DeprecationWarning`
Base class for warnings about deprecated features when those warnings are intended for other Python developers.

Ignored by the default warning filters, except in the `__main__` module ([PEP 565](https://peps.python.org/pep-0565)). Enabling the [[Python Development Mode]] shows this warning.

The depreciation policy is described in [PEP 387](https://peps.python.org/pep-0387).
