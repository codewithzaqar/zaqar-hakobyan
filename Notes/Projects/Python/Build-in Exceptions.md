# Exception context
#### *exception* `Exception`
All built-in, non-system-exiting exceptions are derived from this class. All user-defined exceptions should also be derived from this class.
# Concrete exceptions
#### *exception* `OSError([arg])`
#### *exception* `ZeroDivisionError`
Raised when the second argument of a division or modulo operation is zero. The associated value is a string indicating the type of the operands and the operation.
The following exceptions are kept for compatibility with previous versions; starting from Python 3.3, they are aliases of [[Build-in Exceptions#*exception* `OSError([arg])`|OSError]].
# Warnings
The following exceptions are used as warning categories; see the [[warnings - Warning control#Warning Categories|Warning Categories]] documentation for more details
#### *exception* `Warning`
Base class for warning categories.
#### *exception* `UserWarning`
Base class for warnings generated by user code.
#### *exception* `DeprecationWarning`
Base class for warnings about deprecated features when those warnings are intended for other Python developers.

Ignored by the default warning filters, except in the `__main__` module ([PEP 565](https://peps.python.org/pep-0565)). Enabling the [[Python Development Mode]] shows this warning.

The depreciation policy is described in [PEP 387](https://peps.python.org/pep-0387)
