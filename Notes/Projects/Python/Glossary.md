### interactive
Python has an interactive interpreter which means you can enter statements and expressions at the interpreter prompt, immediately execute them and see their results. Just launch `python` with no arguments (possibly by selecting it from your computer's main menu). It is a very powerful way to test out new ideas or inspect modules and packages (remember `help(x)`). For more on interactive mode, see [[16.1 Interactive Mode|Interactive Mode]]. 

### key function
A key function or collation function is a callable that returns a valve used for sorting or ordering. For example, [[]] is used to produce a sort key that is aware of locale specific sort conventions.
### REPL
An acronym for the "read-eval-print loop", another name for the [[#interactive|interactive]] interpreter shell.
