### Notes on availability

- An "Availability: Unix" note means that this function is commonly found on Unix systems. It does not make any claims about its existence on a specific operation system.
- If not separately noted, all functions that claim "Availability: Unix" are supported on MacOS, iOS and Android, all of which build on a Unix core.
- If an availability note contains both a minimum Kernel version and a minimum libc version, then both conditions must be hold. For example a feature with note *Availability: Linux >= 3.17 with glibc >= 2.27* requires both Linux 3.17 or never and glibc 2.27 or never.
