The interpreter interface resembles that of the UNIX shell, but provides some additional methods of invocation:
-  When called with standard input connected to a tty device, it prompts for commands and executes them until an EOF (an end-of-file character, you can produce that with `Ctrl-D` on UNIX or `Ctrl-Z`, Enter on Windows) is read.
