#### `--with-pydebug`
[[3.3.8. Python Debug Build|Build Python in debug mode]]: define the `Py_DEBUG` macro (disabled by default).
#### `--with-assertions`
Build with C assertions enabled (default is no): `assert(...);` and `_PyObject_ASSERT(...);`.

If set, the `NDEBUG` macro is not defined in the [[3.5.2. Compiler flags#OPT|OPT]] compiler variable.

See also the [[3.3.9 Debug options#`--with-pydebug`|--with-pydebug]] option ([[3.3.8. Python Debug Build|debug build]]) which also enables assertions.
> *Added in version 3.6.*
#### `--with-address-sanitizer`
Enable AddressSanitizer memory error detector, asan (default is no). To improve ASan detection capabilities you may also want to combine this with [[3.3.7. Performance options#`--without-pymalloc`|--without-pymalloc]] to disable the specialized small-object allocator whose allocations are not tracked by ASan.
