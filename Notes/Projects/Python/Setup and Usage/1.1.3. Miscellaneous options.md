#### -d
Turn on parser debugging output (for expert only). See also the [[1.2. Environment variables#PYTHONDEBUG|PYTHONDEBUG]] 
#### -X
Reserved for various implementation-specific options. CPython currently defines the following possible values:
- `-X faulthandler` to enable [[faulthandler - Dump the Python traceback|faulthandler]]. See also [[1.2. Environment variables#PYTHONFAULTHANDLER]].
 > *Added in version 3.3*.
 
 - `-X showrefcount` to output the total reference count and number of used memory blocks when the program finishes or after each statement in the interpreter. This only works on [[3.3.8. Python Debug Build|debug builds]].
 > *Added in version 3.4.*
