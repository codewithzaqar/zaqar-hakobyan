Unlike C, all comparisons operations in Python have the same priority, which is lower than that of any arithmetic, shifting or bitwise operation. Also unlike C, expressions like `a < b < c` have the interpretation that is conventional in mathematics:

##### comparison  ::=  [[6.9. Binary bitwise operations#or_expr =|or_expr]] ([[6.10. Comparisons#comp_operator|comp_operator]] [[6.9. Binary bitwise operations#or_expr = 6.9. Binary bitwise operations xor_expr 6.9. Binary bitwise operations or_expr " " 6.9. Binary bitwise operations xor_expr|or_expr]])*
##### comp_operator :: = "<" | ">" | "==" | "<=" | "!=" | "is" ["not"] | ["not"] "in"

Comparisons yield boolean values: `True` or `False`. Custom *rich comparison methods* may return non-boolean values. In this case Python will call [[Built-in Functions|bool( )]]
